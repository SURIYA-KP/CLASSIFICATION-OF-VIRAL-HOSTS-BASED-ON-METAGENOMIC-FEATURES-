It includes information on virus names, taxonomic groups, and biological sample identifiers, although the latter is often missing. The dataset covers 4,893 unique virus names classified into 17 distinct taxonomic groups. Each entry has a unique assembly accession number, indicating a specific version of the genome assembly, and all entries are marked as \"Complete.\" Genome sizes and GC content vary among the viruses. The dataset also provides information about the host organisms, which include bacteria, fungi, plants, and vertebrates, reflecting the diverse range of virus-host interactions. Additionally, it lists the number of coding sequences (CDS) per virus and includes FTP links to GenBank and RefSeq entries, offering access to detailed genomic data. While some columns like \"BioSample\" and \"Neighbors\" have many missing values, most columns are well-populated, making this dataset a rich resource for virologists and researchers studying viral diversity and genomics.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>#Organism Name</th>\n","      <th>Organism Groups</th>\n","      <th>BioSample</th>\n","      <th>BioProject</th>\n","      <th>Assembly</th>\n","      <th>Level</th>\n","      <th>Size(Mb)</th>\n","      <th>GC%</th>\n","      <th>Replicons</th>\n","      <th>Host</th>\n","      <th>CDS</th>\n","      <th>Neighbors</th>\n","      <th>Release Date</th>\n","      <th>GenBank FTP</th>\n","      <th>RefSeq FTP</th>\n","      <th>Replicons.1</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Hamiltonella virus APSE1</td>\n","      <td>Viruses;dsDNA viruses, no RNA stage;Podoviridae</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>PRJNA14047</td>\n","      <td>GCA_000837745.1</td>\n","      <td>Complete</td>\n","      <td>0.036524</td>\n","      <td>43.900</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_000935.1/AF157835.1</td>\n","      <td>bacteria</td>\n","      <td>54</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>1999-10-26T00:00:00Z</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000...</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000...</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_000935.1/AF157835.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Chalara elegans RNA Virus 1</td>\n","      <td>Viruses;dsRNA viruses;Totiviridae</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>PRJNA15126</td>\n","      <td>GCA_000858705.1</td>\n","      <td>Complete</td>\n","      <td>0.005310</td>\n","      <td>52.600</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_005883.1/AY561500.1</td>\n","      <td>fungi</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>2004-03-23T00:00:00Z</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000...</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000...</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_005883.1/AY561500.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Vibrio phage martha 12B12</td>\n","      <td>Viruses;dsDNA viruses, no RNA stage;Myoviridae</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>PRJNA39219</td>\n","      <td>GCA_000904715.1</td>\n","      <td>Complete</td>\n","      <td>0.033277</td>\n","      <td>45.800</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_021070.1/HQ316581.1</td>\n","      <td>bacteria</td>\n","      <td>51</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>2013-03-11T00:00:00Z</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000...</td>\n","      <td>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000...</td>\n","      <td>Unknown:NC_021070.1/HQ316581.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum partitivirus S</td>\n","      <td>Viruses;dsRNA viruses;Partitiviridae</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>PRJNA39595</td>\n","      <td>GCA_000884095.1</td>\n","      <td>Complete</td>\n","      <td>0.003726</td>\n","      <td>44.145</td>\n","      <td>RNA 1:NC_013014.1/GQ280377.1;
